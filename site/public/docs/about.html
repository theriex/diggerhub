<h1>About Digger</h1>

<p>Digger began in late 2020 as a project to categorize music for contextual
retrieval, where a <em>context</em> is defined as any listening situation
you might otherwise create a playlist for.  The idea was to take a myriad of
contexts, factor out the common elements, and support autoplay without
having to make playlists.  The belief this was possible grew out of the
SlideMatch project in 2009, which used 10 scalar characterizations to match
music for retrieval.  The challenge for Digger was to create similar
retrieval power with far fewer song data requirements. </p>

<p>By combining dual scalar values with well chosen keywords, Digger was
able to achieve substantial retrieval power.  For example Instead of
playlists for "Brunch", "Beach", "Dinner", "Party" and such, a single
"Social" keyword combined with energy level and approachability filtering
provides equivalent or better access.  Retrieval processing prefers what was
least recently played, so it will dig through all matching songs in the
least boring order.  Digger was initially tested on a diverse collection of
10k+ songs to verify the rating process was reasonable and contextual
retrieval worked well. </p>


<h2>The power of song ratings</h2>

<p>Song ratings go beyond retrieval to help describe your impression of
great tracks to others: </p>

<div class="textcontentdiv boxedcontentdiv">
<p>When you <img class="featureico" src="img/share.png"/> share a song, the
<em>Title</em>, <em>Artist</em>, <em>Album</em>, <em>Keywords</em>,
<em>Approachability</em> and <em>Energy Level</em>, and your
<img class="featureico" src="img/comment.png"/> personal comment are all
collected to send to anyone however you like. </p>
</div>

<p>Song ratings can also be used for collaboration. </p>


<h2>DiggerHub</h2>

<p>Initially created as a mechanism to synchronize Digger data across
devices using only bare minimum personal information, DiggerHub now also
provides for structured collaboration that respects your time and
energy. </p>

<div id="collabdiv">
<h4>Connect</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/connect.png"/>
<p>Find friends and music fans by their Digger name. If you haven't added
any friends yet, and you want to get a feel for how things work, you can
click "Connect Me" to add whoever the hub picks for you. </p>

<h4>Match</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/match.png"/>
<p>See how much music you have in common. If you have songs in your
collection that you haven't rated yet, your friends provide default rating
information you can use for contextual retrieval.  The "rcv" tab shows how
many default ratings you've received.  The "snd" tab shows how many default
ratings they have received from you.  If you remove a friend, their default
ratings are also removed.  When you play a song, any default rating
information for that song becomes yours. </p>

<h4>Messages</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/messages.png"/>
<p>See what your friends have shared recently and get automatic
recommendations from your friends matching your current listening
parameters. </p>
</div>
