<h1>About Digger</h1>

<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>Digger began in late 2020 as a project to categorize music for contextual
retrieval, where a <em>context</em> is defined as any listening situation
you might otherwise create a playlist for.  The idea was to take a myriad of
contexts, factor out the common elements, and support filtered continuous
selection instead of having to make playlists.  The belief this was possible
grew out of the SlideMatch project in 2009, which used 10 scalar
characterizations to match music for retrieval.  The challenge for Digger
was to create similar retrieval power with far fewer song data
requirements. </p>

<p>By combining dual scalar values with well chosen keywords, Digger was
able to achieve substantial retrieval power.  For example Instead of
playlists for "Brunch", "Beach", "Dinner", "Party" and such, a single
"Social" keyword filtered by approachability and energy level provides
equivalent and more flexible selection.  Retrieval processing prefers what
was least recently played, so the app will "dig" through all matching songs
in the least boring order.  Digger was initially tested on a diverse
collection of 10k+ songs to verify the rating process was reasonable and
contextual retrieval worked well. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<li>Continuous energy level and approachability controls with corresponding range selection filters.
<li>General and custom keywords with positive or negative selection filtering.
<li>Overall rating star slider.
<li>Personal song comments.
<li>Detailed song impression sharing.
<li>Auto sync between devices via DiggerHub.
<li>Selectable playback frequency with automatic skip adjustment.
<li>Sleep button.
<li>Play history and match info displays.
<li>Deck playback tuning.
<li>Realtime reactive search.
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul id="faqul">
<li>Do I need to have my own music files to use Digger?
  <div>Yes.</div>
<li>Does Digger modify my music files?
  <div>No.</div>
<li>Can I change which music files I have on my device?
  <div>Yes. Digger will play any and all music files it finds subject to
  whatever filtering and playback constraints you have set, least recently
  played first.</div>
<li>How many music files should I have to use Digger?
  <div>Up to you. You probably want at least 50 songs for a reasonable
  continuous selection experience. I've got over 10k on at least one box. </div>
</ul>

<h2>Listening</h2>

<div class="textcontentdiv boxedcontentdiv">
Digger provides three access views to support how you want to
play music from your collection:
<div class="docicodiv"><img class="featureico" src="img/deck.png"/></div>
(deck) fetches a mix of songs matching your current listening context,
<div class="docicodiv"><img class="featureico" src="img/album.png"/></div>
(album) plays albums or suggests them, and
<div class="docicodiv"><img class="featureico" src="img/search.png"/></div>
(search) finds albums and songs you are looking for quickly and easily.
</div>

<div class="paradiv">
Search view matches your comments, artists, albums, and song titles,
updating a result tree of of albums and songs as you type.  Album view has a
suggestions button
<div class="docicodiv"><img class="featureico" src="img/suggest.png"/></div>
presenting up to 5 albums you've played least recently.  Deck view shows
parametric retrieval controls and matching songs you can optionally
prioritize or skip.
</div>

<p>Switching between playback views while listening is seamless.  In album
view, playback proceeds sequentially through tracks and then stops.  In deck
view, playback is continuous.  Digger prefers songs you have listened to
least recently, and it also avoids overplaying in deck mode by respecting
the playback frequency of each song.  The maximum deck playback frequency is
once every 24 hours.  If you flag a song as tired, frequency moves from once
every 90 days to once a year depending how often you skip the song.  Because
Digger prefers least recently played songs, frequency tuning is not usually
necessary, but when you need it, it's there.  Album view and search do not
follow frequency constraints. </p>


<h2>Rating controls</h2>

<p>The Digger player panel lets you capture much of what you feel without
having to come up with descriptive words for every song.  The knobs,
sliders, and keyword toggles are tools for active listening that connect
music to past, present and future you.  They make it easy to record the
basics without having to put your feelings into words.  It's an enhanced
listening experience that works for you and grows with you over time. </p>

<div class="textcontentdiv boxedcontentdiv">
<img class="featureico" src="img/share.png"/>
Sharing a song copies the
<em>Title</em>, <em>Artist</em>, <em>Album</em>, <em>Keywords</em>, 
<em>Approachability</em> and <em>Energy Level</em>, together with your
comment <img class="featureico" src="img/comment.png"/> into a single
statement to send however you like.
</div>

<p>Deck range selectors and three-way keyword toggles let you pull music
from your collection matching a wide range of listening situations. </p>


<h2>DiggerHub</h2>

<p>Initially created as a mechanism to synchronize Digger data across
devices with bare minimum personal identification, DiggerHub also
provides for structured collaboration that respects your time: </p>

<div id="collabdiv">
<h4>Connect</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/connect.png"/>
<p>Find friends and music fans by their Digger name. If you haven't added
any friends yet, and you want to get a feel for how things work, you can
click "Connect Me" to add whoever the hub picks for you. </p>

<h4>Match</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/match.png"/>
<p>See how much music you have in common. If you have songs in your
collection that you haven't rated yet, your friends provide default rating
information you can use for contextual retrieval.  The "rcv" tab shows how
many default ratings you've received.  The "snd" tab shows how many default
ratings they have received from you.  If you remove a friend, their default
ratings are also removed.  When you play a song, any default rating
information for that song becomes yours. </p>

<h4>Messages</h4>
<img src="docs/collab/messages.png"/>
<p>See what your friends have shared recently.  Get automatic
recommendations matching their ratings to your listening parameters. </p>
</div>
