Sync hub and home for digger app.

DiggerHub saves updated account and song info sent from the Digger app.  It
serves as a data backup, and provides automatic synchronization so you can
run Digger on different devices and keep all your ratings and last played
times up to date.

In the Digger app, a song rating can be accessed by all users authorized in
the app installation.  On DiggerHub, all song ratings are specific to a
DiggerHub account.
